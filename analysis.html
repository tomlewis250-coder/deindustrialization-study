                <h3>December 11, 2001: The Day Everything Changed</h3>
                <p>When China joined the World Trade Organization, U.S. imports from China surged from $100 billion to over $400 billion annually within a decade. Research by economists Autor, Dorn, and Hanson — the "China Syndrome" — quantified what workers already knew: trade policy had devastating and permanent consequences for American manufacturing communities.</p>

                <h4>The Causal Connection: More Exposure, More Destruction</h4>
                <p>Counties with higher exposure to Chinese import competition experienced significantly greater manufacturing job losses. The correlation is clear across all measures: trade policy had real, lasting, and geographically concentrated consequences. Counties in the top quintile of China shock exposure lost manufacturing jobs at nearly twice the rate of those in the bottom quintile.</p>

High-exposure counties not only lost more manufacturing jobs — they now have higher poverty rates, lower incomes, lower labor force participation, and higher SNAP utilization two decades later. This wasn't a temporary adjustment shock. It was a permanent restructuring.</p>

                    <p>Labor force participation declined across most of America, but the drop was steeper in deindustrialized counties. Workers who lost manufacturing jobs — especially older workers with industry-specific skills — often couldn't find comparable work and eventually stopped looking.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Counties with severe manufacturing decline now have only <strong>55% labor force participation</strong>, compared to <strong>61%</strong> in counties where manufacturing grew.</p>

                <p>Grouping counties into five categories — from Severe Decline to Growth — reveals a clear staircase pattern: counties that retained or grew manufacturing employment have substantially better prime-age employment rates. The difference between "Severe Decline" and "Growth" counties is 6.3 percentage points of labor force participation, equivalent to hundreds of thousands of additional workers nationwide.</p>
